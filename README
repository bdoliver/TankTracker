Simple web application for tracking things about my aquariums
	- tanks & water type (whether salt or fresh water)
	- recording of test results
	- graphing of test results over time
	- misc notes, inventory, etc. per tank

Things I'd like to add:
	- means of uploading pics
	- links to external websites
		(eg. find fish species on wikipedia or similar)
	- automated reminders when tests, dosing, maintenance, etc are due
	- ???

Not meant to be pretty or polished & probably not a lot of use to others.

My main reason for writing it was to learn more about the perl Dancer 
framework, and using DBIx::Class for database access.   The original version
was done using Rose::DB which worked, but was a nuisance to configure. I 
later discovered the Dancer::Plugin::DBIC module which makes configuring the
db connection a breeze, hence the switch.
