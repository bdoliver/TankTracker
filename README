Simple web application for tracking things about my aquariums
	- tanks & water type (whether salt or fresh water)
	- recording of test results
	- graphing of test results over time
	- misc notes, inventory, etc. per tank

Todo:
        - add proper authentication & authorisation
          (delusions of grandeur: maybe this just might be useful for other
           aquarists... hosted somewhere for multiuser access)
	- inventory system for keeping track of assets, livestock, consumables
          and whatever else.

Things I'd like to add:
	- means of uploading pics
	- links to external websites
		(eg. find fish species on wikipedia or similar)
	- automated reminders when tests, dosing, maintenance, etc are due
	- ???

Not meant to be pretty or polished & probably not a lot of use to others.
